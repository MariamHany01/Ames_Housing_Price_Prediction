# Ames Housing Price Prediction

## Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end regression pipeline using the Ames Housing Dataset to predict housing prices. The notebook includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model training (Linear Regression, Ridge), and evaluation using R² and RMSE metrics.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the [Ames Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prevek18/ames-housing-dataset/data), which contains 82 features and 2930 entries describing various attributes of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.

## Features
- **Data Loading & Initial Exploration**: Loads the dataset and performs initial exploration to understand its structure and statistics.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzes missing values and visualizes data distributions.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values and prepares the dataset for modeling.
- **Feature Engineering**: Transforms and selects relevant features to improve model performance.
- **Model Training**: Uses Linear Regression and Ridge regression models.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluates models using R² and RMSE metrics.

## Tools & Techniques
- **Tools**: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib.
- **Techniques**: Data imputation, feature transformation, regularization, cross-validation.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded and initial exploration is performed to understand its shape, features, and statistics.
2. **Missing Values Analysis**: Identifies and handles missing values in the dataset.
3. **Visualization**: Uses Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize data distributions and relationships.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Prepares features for modeling, including handling skewness and scaling.
5. **Model Training**: Trains and evaluates Linear Regression and Ridge models.
6. **Results**: Presents model performance metrics and insights.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Ensure all required libraries are installed (`numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`).
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and modeling steps.
